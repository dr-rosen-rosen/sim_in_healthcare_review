T1  - Effect of Emergency Department Mattress Compressibility on Chest Compression Depth Using a Standardized Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Board, a Slider Transfer Board, and a Flat Spine Board: A Simulation-Based Study
AB  - Introduction: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed on a mattress decreases effective chest compression depth. Using a CPR board partially attenuates mattress compressibility. We aimed to determine the effect of a CPR board, a slider transfer board, a CPR board with a slider transfer board, and a flat spine board on chest compression depth with a mannequin placed on an emergency department mattress. Methods: The study used a cross-over study design. The CPR-certified healthcare providers performed 2 minutes of compressions on a mannequin in five conditions, an emergency department mattress with: (a) no hard surface, (b) a CPR board, (c) a slider transfer board, (d) a CPR board and slider transfer board, and (e) a flat spine board. Compression depths were measured from two sources for each condition: (a) an internal device measuring sternum-to-spine compression and (b) an external device measuring sternum-to-spine compression plus mattress compression. The difference of the two measures (ie, depleted compression depth) was summarized and compared between conditions. Results: A total of 10,203 individual compressions from 10 participants were analyzed. The mean depleted compression depths (percentage depletion) secondary to mattress effect were the following: 23.6 mm (29.7%) on a mattress only, 13.7 mm (19.5%) on a CPR board, 16.9 mm (23.1%) on a slider transfer board, 11.9 mm (17.3%) on a slider transfer board plus backboard, and 10.3 mm (15.4%) on a flat spine board. The differences in percentage depletion across conditions were statistically significant. Conclusion: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation providers should use a CPR board and slider transfer board or a flat spine board alone because these conditions are associated with the smallest amount of mattress compressibility.

T1  - Simulation Training for Residents Focused on Mechanical Ventilation: A Randomized Trial Using Mannequin-Based Versus Computer-Based Simulation
AB  - Introduction: Advances in knowledge regarding mechanical ventilation (MV), in particular lung-protective ventilation strategies, have been shown to reduce mortality. However, the translation of these advances in knowledge into better therapeutic performance in real-life clinical settings continues to lag. High-fidelity simulation with a mannequin allows students to interact in lifelike situations; this may be a valuable addition to traditional didactic teaching. The purpose of this study is to compare computer-based and mannequin-based approaches for training residents on MV. Methods: This prospective randomized single-blind trial involved 50 residents. All participants attended the same didactic lecture on respiratory pathophysiology and were subsequently randomized into two groups: the mannequin group (n = 25) and the computer screenbased simulator group (n = 25). One week later, each underwent a training assessment using five different scenarios of acute respiratory failure of different etiologies. Later, both groups underwent further testing of patient management, using in situ high-fidelity simulation of a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Results: Baseline knowledge was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.72). Regarding the training assessment, no significant differences were detected between the groups. In the final assessment, the scores of only the mannequin group significantly improved between the training and final session in terms of either global rating score [3.0 (2.54.0) vs. 2.0 (2.03.0), P = 0.005] or percentage of key score (82% vs. 71%, P = 0.001). Conclusions: Mannequin-based simulation has the potential to improve skills in managing MV.

T1  - Design and Evaluation of a Low-Cost Speculum Examination Training Model
AB  - Introduction: Learning how to perform a speculum examination is a key component of the medical student curriculum, yet there is a paucity of data on the validity of available speculum examination models. This purpose of this study is to design, evaluate, and improve a low-cost speculum examination model. Methods: A speculum examination training model was created using low-cost or recycled materials from other simulators. A total of 54 medical students, residents, and faculty in the obstetrics and gynecology department of a single academic institution performed speculum examinations on the model. Each participant completed a survey to provide qualitative and quantitative data. Using this feedback from participants, adjustments were made to the model and a similar survey was repeated with a total of 35 medical students and residents. Results: The first iteration of the model was viewed positively by most participants. Eighty-three percent gave the model either a very realistic or realistic rating. Ninety-four percent thought the model was a very useful or useful teaching device. There were few significant differences in quantitative data based on experience level. Qualitative feedback yielded generally positive remarks with areas for improvement. The second iteration of the model was successful in differentiating between novice and skilled participants: residents were significantly better at identifying cervical position compared with students. Eighty-nine percent of participants thought the model was very useful or useful, whereas 49% thought the model was very realistic or realistic. Discussion: The first iteration of the model demonstrated realism and usefulness; however, it lacked construct validity. Participant feedback yielded several helpful suggestions to improve the model. The second and final iteration of the model differentiated between novice and skilled participants at the cost of realism. This low-cost model is a useful tool to aid in teaching the speculum examination. Further development and study of the model could lead to a valid tool to evaluate speculum examination skills.

T1  - Improving the Clinical Skills Performance of Graduating Medical Students Using "WISE OnCall," a Multimedia Educational Module
AB  - Introduction: Transitions to residency programs are designed to maximize quality and safety of patient care, as medical students become residents. However, best instructional or readiness assessment practices are not yet established. We sought to study the impact of a screen-based interactive curriculum designed to prepare interns to address common clinical coverage issues (WISE OnCall) on the clinical skills demonstrated in simulation and hypothesize that performance would improve after completing the module. Methods: Senior medical students were recruited to participate in this single group prestudy/poststudy. Students responded to a call from a standardized nurse (SN) and assessed a standardized patient (SP) with low urine output, interacted with a 45-minute WISE OnCall module on the assessment and management of oliguria, and then evaluated a different SP with low urine output of a different underlying cause. Standardized patients assessed clinical skills with a 37-item, behaviorally anchored checklist measuring clinical skills (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.55-0.81). Standardized nurses rated care quality and safety and collaboration and interprofessional communication using a 33-item literature-based, anchored checklist (ICC, 0.47-0.52). Standardized patient and SN ratings of the same student performance were correlated (r, 0.37-0.62; P < 0.01). Physicians assessed clinical reasoning quality based on the students' patient encounter note (ICC, 0.55-0.68), ratings that did not correlate with SP and SN ratings. We compared pre-post clinical skills performance and clinical reasoning. Fifty-two medical students (31%) completed this institutional review board approved study. Results: Performance as measured by the SPs, SNs, and the postencounter note all showed improvement with mostly moderate to large effect sizes (range of Cohen's d, 0.30-1.88; P < 0.05) after completion of the online module. Unexpectedly, professionalism as rated by the SP was poorer after the module (Cohen's d, -0.93; P = 0.000). Discussion: A brief computer-based educational intervention significantly improved graduating medical students' clinical skills needed to be ready for residency.

T1  - The Call and the Challenge of Pediatric Resuscitation and Simulation Research in Low-Resource Settings
AB  - Summary Statement: The greatest burden of younger than 5 years mortality is in low- and middle-income nations where education resources are often few. The World Health Organization recommends scale-up of simulation in these settings, but it has been poorly studied. Although there has been an increase of contextualized resuscitation simulation programs designed for these settings, sustaining clinical outcomes and provider skill retention have remained research gaps. Our team designed a study to evaluate skill retention after an initial Helping Babies Breathe training at a rural Kenya referral hospital between randomized learner groups receiving supervised mock codes with debriefing versus just-in-time training with a peer. Although we saw sustained skills retention and some clinical improvements, we were unable to answer our research question because of numerous challenges, mainly that hospital leadership preferred the implementation of 1 arm of the study over another because of lack of protected education time and resources, eliminating differences between randomized study groups. Further challenges included lack of familiarity with simulation and debriefing and lack of protected educational resources and time, cultural differences in giving feedback, undeveloped systems for documentation, and high acuity and clinical volume. Our experience teaches many important lessons in how best to implement and study simulation in low-resource settings. Best practices include long-term partnerships, flexibility, community and staff engagement, mixed methodologies including community-based participatory methods, and careful attention to educational and research capacity building.

T1  - A Novel Task Trainer for Penile Corpus Cavernosa Aspiration
AB  - Introduction: Priapism is a rare yet time sensitive emergency with potentially significant morbidity. A novel task trainer was developed for corpus cavernosa aspiration and phenylephrine injection. The primary aim of this study was to assess model realism and usefulness for emergency medicine resident procedural education. Secondarily, an assessment of comfort level with the procedure before and after intervention was performed. Methods: A priapism model containing corpus cavernosa and spongiosum analogs was constructed. The models and evaluation forms were pilot tested by faculty and then tested for realism and usefulness in a sample of 49 residents after a brief training session. Secondary end points included resident comfort with cavernosa aspiration before and after the session of the model on a visual analog scale. Results: Eight faculty pilot tested the procedure model and evaluated it based on a 5-point scale. They unanimously felt that the model was realistic [mean = 4.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.85.0] and useful for resident education (mean = 4.8, 95% CI = 4.45.0). The model was then evaluated for realism and usefulness in 49 residents. The model was felt to be realistic (mean = 4.3, 95% CI = 4.04.5) and useful for resident education (mean = 4.6, 95% CI = 4.44.8). Residents also noted an improvement in comfort performing the procedure before and after simulation session with the mean visual analog scale rating increasing from 34.3 to 83.8 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: An easily constructed priapism task trainer was felt to be realistic and useful for resident education. Secondarily, use of the model in a simulation session can improve resident comfort in an important and infrequent procedure. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Death of a Simulated Pediatric Patient: Toward a More Robust Theoretical Framework
AB  - Introduction: A theoretical framework was recently proposed that encapsulates learner responses to simulated death due to action or inaction in the pediatric context. This framework, however, was developed at an institution that allows simulated death and thus does not address the experience of those centers at which this technique is not used. To address this, we performed a parallel qualitative study with the intent of augmenting the initial framework. Methods: We conducted focus groups, using a constructivist grounded theory approach, using physicians and nurses who have experienced a simulated cardiac arrest. The participants were recruited via e-mail. Transcripts were analyzed by coders blinded to the original framework to generate a list of provisional themes that were iteratively refined. These themes were then compared with the themes from the original article and used to derive a consensus model that incorporated the most relevant features of each. Results: Focus group data yielded 7 themes. Six were similar to those developed in the original framework. One important exception was noted; however, those learners not exposed to patient death due to action or inaction often felt that the mannequin's survival was artificial. This additional theme was incorporated into a revised framework. Discussion: The original framework addresses most aspects of learner reactions to simulated death. Our work suggests that adding the theme pertaining to the lack of realism that can be perceived when the mannequin is unexpectedly saved results in a more robust theoretical framework transferable to centers that do not allow mannequin death.

T1  - Physiologically Triggered Digital Cognitive Aid Facilitates Crisis Management in a Simulated Operating Room: A Randomized Controlled Study
AB  - Introduction: Although the benefits of using cognitive aids in anesthesia care have previously been demonstrated, several challenges remain. It must be presented in a timely manner, and providers must be amenable to using the tool once it is available. We hypothesized that anesthesia residents would perform superiorly when presented with a digital cognitive aid (DCogA) that is automatically triggered by a set vital sign aberration. Methods: Thirty anesthesia residents were randomized to either control (with access to hard copy of the cognitive aid) or receive a DCogA projected on their anesthesia information management system with the onset of heart block and associated hypotension. The scenario ended upon commencement of pacing, and the times to interventions were recorded. Results: Fourteen participants were randomized to the control group and 16 to the intervention group DCogA. In the control group, 6 of 14 participants failed to pace, and in the DCogA group, all participants initiated pacing (P < 0.01). Those in the DCogA group were also faster to pace [260.1 (137.5) s vs. 405.1 (201.8) s, P = 0.03]. Both groups were similar with respect to their knowledge of advanced cardiovascular life support as measured by a pretest (P = 0.92). Conclusions: We found those participants who were presented with electronic, physiologically triggered cognitive aids were more likely to appropriately treat heart block by initiating transcutaneous pacing. We believe that adoption of a high-functioning anesthesia information management system designed to detect physiologic perturbations and present appropriate decision support tools would lead to safer intraoperative care.

T1  - Debriefing to Improve Student Ability to Assess and Plan for the Care of Persons With Disability
AB  - Introduction: Although recent literature suggests that students should be trained in the care of persons with disability (PWDs) as a form of cultural sensitivity (CS), healthcare professionals may receive limited experience during their formal training. After pharmacy students in 2 previous years of testing failed to adequately assess and plan for the care of a standardized patient's chief complaint and disability in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), the investigators added debriefing to the OSCE to determine if it would improve student's ability to assess and plan for the care of PWD. Methods: Two sequentially enrolled second-year pharmacy school student cohorts participated in this study (control n = 90; intervention n = 82). During the OSCE, students interviewed and examined a standardized patient with a simulated physical disability and other chronic disease states. Students were then instructed to develop a care plan considering the patient's disability and other disease states. The intervention cohort received debriefing; the control did not. Students documented the care plan in a subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) note. Investigators assessed SOAP note score (general ability of students to write a SOAP note) and CS score (specific ability to care for PWD) to determine the effectiveness of the debriefing. Results: The intervention group showed a significantly higher percent mean CS score than the control group (93.6% +/- 19% and 61.1% +/- 30.7%, respectively, P < 0.001), translating to a mean of 56.2/60 points earned for the intervention group and 36.7/60 points earned for the control group. Scores ranged from 0 to 60 points for both intervention and control groups. Students in the intervention group had an absolute improvement in pass rates (those students scoring 70% on the OSCE) of 59.4% with 92.7% of the students passing in the intervention group versus 33.3% of the students passing in the control group (P < 0.001). The overall SOAP note scores were no different between the 2 cohorts (P = 0.353). Conclusions: Debriefing added to an OSCE improved students' performance in developing care plans for disabled patients. Ideally, longitudinal studies should be completed to determine if these skills transfer from debriefings to clinical practice. Development of effective training and assessment methods is essential for students to obtain adequate skills and knowledge to care for persons with disabilities.

T1  - Increasing Authenticity of Simulation-Based Assessment in Diagnostic Radiology
AB  - Introduction: Clinical reasoning in diagnostic imaging professions is a complex skill that requires processing of visual information and image manipulation skills. We developed a digital simulation-based test method to increase authenticity of image interpretation skill assessment. Methods: A digital application, allowing volumetric image viewing and manipulation, was used for three test administrations of the national Dutch Radiology Progress Test for residents. This study describes the development and implementation process in three phases. To assess authenticity of the digital tests, perceived image quality and correspondence to clinical practice were evaluated and compared with previous paper-based tests (PTs). Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results were used to improve subsequent tests. Results: Authenticity of the first digital test was not rated higher than the PTs. Test characteristics and environmental conditions, such as image manipulation options and ambient lighting, were optimized based on participants' comments. After adjustments in the third digital test, participants favored the image quality and clinical correspondence of the digital image questions over paper-based image questions. Conclusions: Digital simulations can increase authenticity of diagnostic radiology assessments compared with paper-based testing. However, authenticity does not necessarily increase with higher fidelity. It can be challenging to simulate the image interpretation task of clinical practice in a large-scale assessment setting, because of technological limitations. Optimizing image manipulation options, the level of ambient light, time limits, and question types can help improve authenticity of simulation-based radiology assessments.

T1  - A Simulation-Based Prospective Cohort Study on Teaching Best Practices in Firearms Safety
AB  - Background: Gun violence in the United States is a significant public health concern. The high rate of weapons carriage by Americans places medical providers at risk for exposure to firearms in the workplace and provides an opportunity for patient safety counseling. Few curricular interventions have been published on teaching firearms safety principles to medical providers. Given the risk of encountering firearms in the workplace and the opportunity to engage patients in firearms safety counseling, providers may benefit from dedicated training on safely handling firearms. Methods: This was a prospective cohort pilot study of a simulation-based educational intervention for third- and fourth-year medical students enrolled in an emergency medicine subinternship and emergency medicine bootcamp elective. Before undergoing the educational intervention, students completed a preintervention simulation case during which they discovered a model firearm in the patient's belongings and were asked to remove it. Students then received the intervention that included a discussion and demonstration on how to safely remove a firearm in the clinical setting. Two weeks later, the students were presented with a model firearm in a different simulation case, which they needed to remove. During the preintervention and postintervention simulations, students were evaluated on their performance of the critical actions in firearm removal using an 8-item checklist. Students' scores on this checklist were compared. Results: Fifty-three students participated in the study, 25 of whom completed the postintervention assessment. The median number of correctly performed critical actions preintervention was 5 (interquartile range = 4-6) and postintervention was 7 (interquartile range = 6-8, P < 0.001). Students showed particular improvement in 4 steps: holding the firearm by the grip only, pointing the firearm in a safe direction at all times, removing the firearm from the immediate patient care area and placing it in a safe area, and ensuring that the firearm is monitored and untouched until police or security personnel arrive to secure it. Conclusions: This educational intervention is the first to formally teach students about the safe handling of firearms found in the clinical care space. This low-cost pilot project is easily transferrable to other training centers for teaching principles of safe firearms handling. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - A Simulation-Based Failure Mode Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Control and Prevention in Emergency Departments
AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] outbreak has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems of sustainable infection prevention and control measures worldwide, particularly the emerging issues with an insufficient supply of personal protective equipment. The aim of this study was to provide an action plan for mitigation of occupational hazards and nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 through a failure mode analysis based on observations during in situ simulations. Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional, observational, simulation-based study was performed in Latvia from March 2 to 26, 2020. This study was conducted at 7 hospitals affiliated with Riga Stradins University. The presentation of a COVID-19 patient was simulated with an in situ simulations, followed by a structured debrief. Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis is a tool for conducting a systematic, proactive analysis of a process in which harm may occur. We used Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis to analyze performance gaps and systemic issues. Results: A total of 67 healthcare workers from 7 hospitals participated in the study (range = 4-17). A total of 32 observed failure modes were rated using a risk matrix. Twenty-seven failure modes (84.4%) were classified as either medium or high risk or were single-point weaknesses, hence evaluated for action type and action; 11 (40.7%) were related to organizational, 11 (40.7%) to individual, and 5 (18.5%) to environmental factors. Conclusions: Simulation-based failure mode analysis helped us identify the risks related to the preparedness of the healthcare workers and emergency departments for the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia. We believe that this approach can be implemented to assess and maintain readiness for the outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases in the future. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Development of a Smartphone-Based Skin Simulation Model for Medical Education
AB  - Introduction: Teaching dermatology to medical students entails a series of lectures, pictures, and hands-on skin examinations to convey a sense of skin features and textures, often by use of simulated skin models. However, such methods can often lack accurate visual and tactile texture representation of skin lesions. To facilitate learning, we have developed a smartphone-based skin simulation model, which provides a configurable visual and tactile sense of a lesion by using the ubiquitous availability of smartphone-based mobile platforms. Methods: A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) overlay was used as a configurable translucent elastomer material to model the stiffness and texture of skin. A novel custom smartphone-based app was developed to capture images of various skin lesions, which were subsequently displayed on a tablet or second smartphone, over which the PDMS model skin elastomer was placed. Using the local Bluetooth connection between mobile devices, an iterative feedback algorithm corrected the visual distortion caused by the optical scattering of the translucent elastomer, enabling better virtual visualization of the lesion. Results: The developed smartphone-based app corrected the distortion of images projected through the simulated skin elastomer. Surface topography of the developed PDMS elastomer provided a more accurate representation of skin texture. Conclusions: In this investigation, we developed a smartphone-based skin lesion visualization app with a simulated skin elastomer for training/education in not only dermatology but also all general medical specialties that examine the skin. This technique has the potential to advance the educational experience by giving students the ability to see, touch, and feel pragmatic skin textures and lesions.

T1  - Psychometric Validation of Central Venous Catheter Insertion Mastery Learning Checklist Data and Decisions
AB  - Introduction: Resident physicians are expected to acquire competence at central venous catheter (CVC) insertion to a mastery standard. Valid competence decisions about resident physicians' CVC performance rely on reliable data and rigorous achievement standards. This study used data from 3 CVC simulation-based mastery learning studies involving internal medicine (IM) and emergency medicine (EM) residents to address 2 questions: What is the effectiveness of a CVC mastery learning education intervention? Are minimum passing standards (MPSs) set by faculty supported by item response theory (IRT) analyses? Methods: Pretraining and posttraining skills checklist data were drawn from 3 simulation-based mastery learning research reports about CVC internal jugular (IJ) and subclavian (SC) insertion skill acquisition. Residents were required to meet or exceed a posttest skills MPS. Generalized linear mixed effect models compared checklist performance from pre to postintervention. Minimum passing standards were determined by Angoff and Hofstee standard setting methods. Item response theory models were used for cut-score evaluation. Results: Internal medicine and EM residents improved significantly on every IJ and SC checklist item after mastery learning. Item response theory analyses support the IJ and SC MPSs. Conclusions: Mastery learning is an effective education intervention to achieve clinical skill acquisition among IM and EM residents. Item response theory analyses reveal desirable measurement properties for the MPSs previously set by expert faculty panels. Item response theory analysis is useful for evaluating standards for mastery learning interventions. The CVC mastery learning curriculum, reliable outcome data, and high achievement standards together contribute to reaching valid decisions about the competence of resident physicians to perform the clinical procedure.

T1  - Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice Simulation Curriculum Improves Pediatric Trauma Performance: A Prospective Cohort Study
AB  - Introduction: Simulation-based medical education allows learners to refine and maintain clinical skills especially for high-stake situations such as trauma resuscitation. Despite the primary and secondary survey being its foundation, literature shows poor adherence with overall rates as low as 13%. This study evaluates the impact of rapid cycle deliberate practice (RCDP) on primary and secondary survey skill retention. We hypothesized that RCDP-trained surgery residents will have real-world clinical improvement in their survey completion in pediatric trauma resuscitations. Methods: We developed an RCDP trauma resuscitation curriculum. Videos of trauma resuscitations before and after curriculum implementation were scored by 2 blinded reviewers using a modified Pediatric Trauma Assessment Scoring Tool. Actual trauma care by residents who had received the curriculum (study group) was compared with care provided by residents who had not received the curriculum (precurriculum historical control group and a concurrent control group who provided care without receiving the curriculum). Results: One hundred eighty-eight videos were scored with 98 in study group, 33 in concurrent control group, and 57 in historical control group. There was a significant improvement in primary survey performance between study group and historical control group (P < 0.001), but no difference between study group and concurrent control group. There was a significant improvement between study group and 2 control groups in secondary survey performance (both P < 0.001). Conclusions: The RCDP curriculum led to significant improvement in surgical residents' trauma survey performance and had clinical impact on actual patients, which is rare in pediatric trauma simulation literature.

T1  - A Mixed Methods Study of Senior Medical Student Help Calling in an Individual, Acute Care Simulation Experience
AB  - Introduction: The ability to appropriately seek help is a key skill for medical students transitioning to residency. We designed a simulation activity for senior medical students and became interested in studying help calling behaviors and attitudes. Methods: We collected quantitative data regarding help calling for 2 simulation cases and qualitative data using a survey. We undertook a structured thematic analysis based on grounded theory methodology. We identified and compared groups who did and did not call for help. Results: One hundred thirty-four students participated and 122 (91%) completed an evaluation. More students called for help without prompting in the second case (34/134, 25% in first case; 110/134, 82% in second case, P < 0.001). Most students did not call for help in the first case but called in the second case (81, 60%). Our qualitative analysis identified 5 themes: (1) students seek to avoid shame and burdening their team, (2) prior institutional simulation and testing experience may imprint help calling behaviors, (3) students view help calling primarily through an individual lens, (4) students overestimate the complexity of the help calling process, and (5) the simulation environment and intentional experimentation make it difficult to observe natural behavior. When compared with help callers, more non-help callers had phrases coded as "perception of expectations" (37% vs. 10%, P = 0.03). Conclusions: Learners participating in simulation exercises designed to promote help-calling behaviors face training-based barriers related to shame and the desire for autonomy and simulation-based challenges related to assessment.

T1  - "Talk-Through Walk-Through"-A Simulation Approach Adapted During Preparation for COVID-19
AB  - Talk-through walk-through is a simulation format that enables the rapid development and improvement of complex systems for patient care. This approach was adapted from task analysis literature and used to develop and test processes for the safe management of COVID-19 patients. Talk-through walk-through is a 2-part process that is paired with a simulated clinical scenario. The talk-through focuses on identifying and solving major process issues and establishing a shared mental model. The walk-through tests these proposed solutions and identifies previously unanticipated system and process challenges. The talk-through walk-through approach enables process development and testing in a single session, making it particularly valuable for patient care systems that involve multiple locations and healthcare disciplines, and where the availability of these disciplines and time are scarce.

T1  - Safety Considerations for In Situ Simulation in Closed SARS-CoV-2 Units
AB  - Summary Statement: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic placed a tremendous strain on the healthcare system, which led to the deployment of new personnel into acute care settings, early graduation of medical students, and development of new treatment spaces. Education teams at the Montefiore Health System and New York Health and Hospitals/Jacobi Medical Center found simulation, both laboratory-based and in situ, critical to the training of medical staff and investigation of latent safety threats. Through our experience, we encountered unique infection control concerns based on in situ sessions, which prompted us to redesign our programs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Using this experience, we outline our rationale for the use of in situ simulation for newly developed SARS-CoV-2 spaces along with recommendations on safety checks to consider before starting.

T1  - Co-constructive Patient Simulation: A Learner-Centered Method to Enhance Communication and Reflection Skills
AB  - Introduction: In simulation sessions using standardized patients (SPs), it is the instructors, rather than the learners, who traditionally identify learning goals. We describe co-constructive patient simulation (CCPS), an experiential method in which learners address self-identified goals. Methods: In CCPS, a designated learner creates a case script based on a challenging clinical encounter. The script is then shared with an actor who is experienced working as an SP in medical settings. An instructor with experience in the model is involved in creating, editing, and practicing role play of the case. After co-creation of the case, learners with no prior knowledge of the case (peers or a supervisor) interview the SP. The clinical encounter is followed by a group debriefing session. Results: We conducted 6 CCPS sessions with senior trainees in child and adolescent psychiatry. Topics that are difficult to openly talk about may be especially appropriate for the CCPS model-without overt guidance or solicitation, the scripts developed by learners for this series involved: medical errors and error disclosure; racial tensions, including overt racism; interprofessional conflict; transphobia; patient-on-provider violence; sexual health; and the sharing of vulnerability and personal imperfections in the clinical setting. Conclusions: Co-constructive patient simulation provides an alternative multistage and multimodal approach to traditional SP simulation sessions that can adapt iteratively and in real time to new clinical vicissitudes and challenges This learner-centered model holds promise to enrich simulation-based education by fostering autonomous, meaningful, and relevant experiences that are in alignment with trainees' self-identified learning goals.

T1  - A Novel Application of the Modified Angoff Method to Rate Case Difficulty in Simulation-Based Research
AB  - Introduction: Simulation use in research is often limited by controlling for scenario difficulty when using repeated measures. Our study assesses the feasibility of the Modified Angoff Method to reach expert consensus regarding difficulty of medical simulations. We compared scores with participant physiologic stress. Methods: Emergency medicine physicians with expertise in simulation education were asked to review 8 scenarios and estimate the percentage of resident physicians who would perform all critical actions using the modified Angoff method. A standard deviation (SD) of less than 10% of estimated percentage correct signified consensus. Twenty-five residents then performed the 6 scenarios that met consensus and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured. Results: During round 1, experts rated 4/8 scenarios within a 10% SD for postgraduate year 3 (PGY3) and 3/8 for PGY4 residents. In round 2, 6/8 simulation scenarios were within an SD of 10% points for both years. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.84 for PGY3 ratings and 0.89 for PGY4 ratings. A mixed effects analysis of variance showed no significant difference in HRV change from rest to simulation between teams or scenarios. Modified Angoff Score was not a predictor of HRV (multiple R2 = 0.0176). Conclusions: Modified Angoff ratings demonstrated consensus in quantifying the estimated percentage of participants who would complete all critical actions for most scenarios. Although participant HRV did decrease during the scenarios, we were unable to significantly correlate this with ratings. This modified Angoff method is a feasible approach to evaluate simulation difficulty for educational and research purposes and may decrease the time and resources necessary for scenario piloting.

T1  - Gender Minorities in Simulation: A Mixed Methods Study of Medical School Standardized Patient Programs in the United States and Canada
AB  - Purpose: A provider's ability to translate knowledge about transgender health to affirming patient care is key to addressing disparities. However, standardized patient (SP) programs have little published guidance for gender-affirming care or addressing disparities experienced by transgender and nonbinary patients. Method: Between 2018 and 2019, we invited all 208 accredited US and Canadian medical schools to participate in a study to determine how gender minorities are represented in SP encounters. Responding programs (n = 59, response rate = 28%) that represented patients with diverse gender identities were invited to complete semistructured interviews about SP case content, impact, and barriers to this work. Discussions were analyzed using a modified grounded theory method. Results: Fifty nine of 208 eligible programs (response rate = 28.3%) completed our survey and 24 completed interviews. More than half of programs used gender minority SPs (n = 35, 59.3%). More than half of the programs also reported portraying gender minority cases (n = 31, 52.5%). Interviewees described how effective SP simulation required purposeful case development, engaging subject matter experts with lived experience, and ensuring psychological safety of gender minority SPs. Barriers included recruitment, fear of disrespecting gender minority communities, and transphobia. Engaging gender minorities throughout case development, training, and implementation of SP encounters was perceived to reduce bias and stereotyping, but respondents unanimously desired guidance on best practices on SP methodology regarding gender identity. Conclusions: Many programs have established or are developing SP activities that portray gender minority patients. Effective SP simulation hinges on authenticity, but the decisions around case development and casting vary. Specifically, programs lack consensus about who should portray gender minority patients. This research suggests that input from gender minority communities both to inform best practices at the macro level and in an ongoing advisory capacity at the program level will be essential to teach gender-affirming care.

T1  - Use of Simulation to Measure the Effects of Just-in-Time Information to Prevent Nursing Medication Errors: A Randomized Controlled Study
AB  - Introduction: Medication administration error (MAE) is the improper dispensing of medication. It is a significant contributor to the occurrence of medical errors. A novel systems thinking approach using a pediatric simulation and student nurses were used to evaluate the benefit of applying just-in-time information (JITI) to reduce medication errors. Just-in-time information applies highly focused information delivered when needed. Methods: A smart device app was developed to provide JITI medication administration information. The effect JITI had on MAE occurrence was assessed via a controlled study. The study population included 38 teams having 2 to 3 senior nursing students on each team. The teams were separated into a control and 2 intervention groups to complete a medication administration simulation. Results: The intervention groups (100%, N = 10) that made significant use of the JITI app demonstrated improved performance for medication administration over the control group. Familiarity with the app was pivotal to how frequently it was used and to the success of the groups in administering medications. Although those with access to the app having limited training successfully executed the simulation 27.3% (n = 11) of the time, those with extended training had a success rate of 77.8% (n = 9). Conclusions: Providing JITI significantly reduced the occurrence of MAEs for these student nurses. Familiarity with the app, including extended training opportunities, contributed significantly to student success. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Predicting Trainee Clinical Success From Performance at Simulated Endotracheal Intubation
AB  - Introduction: Multiple attempts and failure at endotracheal intubation (ETI) are common for inexperienced practitioners and can cause patient morbidity. A test to predict a provider's likelihood of success at patient ETI could assist decisions about training. This project investigated whether trainees' performance at laryngoscopy on airway mannequins predicted their laryngoscopy outcomes in patients. Methods: Twenty-one consenting first-year anesthesiology residents, emergency medicine residents, and medical students enrolled in this prospective, observational study. They performed laryngoscopy and ETI with a curved laryngoscope on 4 airway mannequins. Metrics included peak dental force, procedure duration, esophageal intubation, laryngeal view, and first-pass ETI success on the mannequins. Trainee data from 203 patient ETIs were collected over a roughly 2-month period centered around the simulation test. Multivariable logistic regression analyzed the relationship of mannequin metrics, participant experience, and a patient difficult airway score with trainee ETI outcomes in patients. Results: Median trainee first-pass success rate at patient ETI was 63%, the rate of ETI problems was 16%, and the esophageal intubation rate was 6%. Laryngoscopy peak dental force, first-pass ETI success, and duration on individual mannequins were significant predictors of patient ETI first-pass success. Metrics from 2 of the 4 mannequins predicted ETI problems. Discussion: Performance metrics from simulated laryngoscopy predicted trainee outcomes during patient ETI. First-pass success and ETI problems affect patient safety and are related to trainee skill. Mannequin laryngoscopy tests could identify trainees who would benefit from additional practice. The metrics could be surrogate end points in research to optimize simulated laryngoscopy training. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Development and Considerations for Virtual Reality Simulations for Resuscitation Training and Stress Inoculation
AB  - Introduction: Resuscitation simulations immerse learners into the complexity of emergency patient management. Head-Mounted Display Virtual Reality (VR) has been used for stress inoculation therapy for phobias and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, VR for stress inoculation in resuscitation leadership training has not been studied. We sought to develop VR simulation for stress inoculation, as exposure therapy training, for resuscitations. Methods: We explain the conceptual design, development, production, and initial evaluation process for 2 VR simulations in infant status epilepticus and pediatric anaphylactic shock. We further describe deliberate game mechanic choices to maximize psychological fidelity. In-virtual reality performance data for time-to-critical actions and stress physiology markers (heart rate, salivary cortisol) were collected from expert pediatric emergency physicians and novice pediatric residents. Data were analyzed to examine differences between the 2 groups for both outcome types to determine the extent of stress response or performance deficit the VR induced. Results: Multiple difficulties and distractions were designed for the 2 scenarios; we evaluated the highest difficulty and environmental distraction versions. Between 19 expert physicians and 15 novice physicians, no performance differences were found in typical airway, breathing, and circulation actions. Residents preferred more lorazepam first-line antiepileptics than attendings (P = 0.003) and performed a cricothyrotomy later than attendings (P = 0.02). Residents, however, manifested higher salivary cortisol levels than attendings (+0.07 [mu]g/dL, 95% confidence interval = 0.03-0.12, P = 0.001). Conclusions: A VR resuscitation simulation manifested expected stress physiology changes in physicians. Further evaluation is needed to determine the effect of VR simulation as longitudinal stress inoculation for healthcare providers. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Is Technology Enhanced Learning Cost-effective to Improve Skills?: The Monash Objective Structured Clinical Examination Virtual Experience
AB  - Introduction: Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are an accepted technique for evaluation of clinical competence in healthcare. However, the economic imperative requires faculty to control cost, using innovative educational strategies such as virtual simulation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost implications of implementing an online interactive learning module [Monash OSCE Virtual Experience (MOVE)]. Methods: All fourth-year pharmacy students enrolled in Monash University in 2017 were provided access to MOVE. Cost-minimization analyses were performed to evaluate the cost of introducing MOVE in the pharmacy course using the smallest cohort size (Malaysia campus) of 40 students as the base case. We also determined under what circumstances MOVE would be more cost-effective, considering the different operational situations such as when student numbers increased or when the number of simulation modules created were increased. Results: The overall cost of setup and implementation of MOVE in the first year of implementation among 40 students was US $94.38 per student. In comparison, the face-to-face workshop cost was US $64.14 per student. On the second year of implementation, the ongoing cost of operation of MOVE was US $32.86 per student compared with US $58.97 per student using face-to-face workshop. A net benefit using MOVE was observed after the third year of implementation. Larger savings were noted when the cohort size extends larger than 100 students. Conclusions: Monash OSCE Virtual Experience was a flexible and cost-effective approach to aid students in preparation for an OSCE and enhanced students' learning experience. The wider applicability of these findings will need to be explored in other settings. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Feasibility of an Interprofessional, Simulation-Based Curriculum to Improve Teamwork Skills, Clinical Skills, and Knowledge of Undergraduate Medical and Nursing Students in Uganda: A Cohort Study
AB  - Introduction: Many deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa are preventable with provision of skilled healthcare. Unfortunately, skills decay after training. We determined the feasibility of implementing an interprofessional (IP) simulation-based educational curriculum in Uganda and evaluated the possible impact of this curriculum on teamwork, clinical skills (CSs), and knowledge among undergraduate medical and nursing students. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study over 10 months. Students were divided into 4 cohorts based on clinical rotations and exposed to rotation-specific simulation scenarios at baseline, 1 month, and 10 months. We measured clinical teamwork scores (CTSs) at baseline and 10 months; CSs at baseline and 10 months, and knowledge scores (KSs) at baseline, 1 month, and 10 months. We used paired t tests to compare mean CTSs and KSs, as well as Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare group CS scores. Results: One hundred five students (21 teams) participated in standardized simulation scenarios. We successfully implemented the IP, simulation-based curriculum. Teamwork skills improved from baseline to 10 months when participants were exposed to: (a) similar scenario to baseline {baseline mean CTS = 55.9% [standard deviation (SD) = 14.4]; 10-month mean CTS = 88.6%; SD = 8.5, P = 0.001}, and (b) a different scenario to baseline [baseline mean CTS = 55.9% (SD = 14.4); 10-month CTS = 77.8% (SD = 20.1), P = 0.01]. All scenario-specific CS scores showed no improvement at 10 months compared with baseline. Knowledge was retained in all scenarios at 10 months. Conclusions: An IP, simulation-based undergraduate curriculum is feasible to implement in a low-resource setting and may contribute to gains in knowledge and teamwork skills.

T1  - Simulation-Based Mastery Learning to Teach Distal Radius Fracture Reduction
AB  - Introduction: Distal radius fractures are common orthopedic injuries managed in emergency departments. Simulation-based mastery learning is widely recognized to improve provider competence for bedside procedures but has not been studied to teach fracture management. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a simulation-based mastery learning curriculum to teach distal radius fracture reduction to novice orthopedic surgery and emergency medicine residents. Methods: We created a novel mastery learning checklist using the Mastery Angoff method of standard setting, paired with a new simulation model designed for this project, to teach orthopedic surgery and emergency medicine interns (N = 22) at the study site. Orthopedic surgery and emergency medicine faculty members participated in checklist development, curriculum design, and implementation. Training included just-in-time asynchronous education with a readiness assessment test, in-classroom expert demonstration, and deliberate practice with feedback. Residents completed a pretest/posttest skills examination and a presurvey/postsurvey assessing procedural confidence. Results: Standard setting resulted in a 41-item checklist with minimum passing score of 37/41 items. All participants met or surpassed the minimum passing score on postexamination. Postsurvey confidence levels were significantly higher than presurvey in all aspects of the distal radius fracture procedure (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a simulation-based mastery learning curriculum improved skills and confidence performing distal radius fracture reductions for orthopedic surgery and emergency medicine interns. Future planned studies include curriculum testing across additional institutions, examination of clinical impact, and application of mastery learning for other orthopedic procedures.

T1  - Content Evidence for Validity of Time-to-Task Initiation: A Novel Measure of Learner Competence
AB  - Introduction: Educators require validated tools to assess learner competency in simulation-based mastery learning. We previously created a simulation to incorporate crisis resource management skills after a needs assessment of our pediatric residency program. We present the development of and content evidence for validity of a task list with time-to-task initiation designed to aid in rapid cycle deliberate practice (RCDP) debriefing and assessment of pediatrics resident learners. Methods: Five board-certified pediatricians developed the initial task list with 30 tasks. We used the Delphi technique to seek content evidence for validity of the initial task list using 17 board-certified pediatricians at 7 institutions across the United States. After finalizing the task list, we video recorded 3 pediatric experts performing the tasks in a simulation. We then used the Delphi technique to establish and to attain agreement on time-to-task initiation. We calculated Cronbach [alpha] coefficient to measure internal consistency of the expert responses. After finalizing the task list, we divided it into 3 stages with 5 separate cycles per stage to direct the educator in performance of RCDP debriefing. Results: The group reached 80% agreement after 2 Delphi rounds with a Cronbach [alpha] coefficient of 0.95. The resultant list included 25 tasks. The group subsequently achieved 80% agreement on the time-to-task initiation in 2 Delphi rounds. Conclusions: We present content evidence for validity of a task list with associated time-to-task initiation for a simulation scenario that incorporates crisis resource management skills and is designed to aid educators in RCDP debriefing. This task list may decrease intereducator inconsistencies in delivery of RCDP for a common pediatric resuscitation scenario. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - The Impact of a 9-Month Booster Training Using Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice on Pediatric Resident PALS Skills
AB  - Introduction: The impact of booster training on pediatric resuscitation skills is not well understood. Rapid cycle deliberate practice (RCDP) to supplement pediatric advanced life support (PALS) training is beginning to be used to improve resuscitation skills. We tested the impact of booster RCDP training performed at 9 months after initial RCDP training on pediatric resuscitation skills of pediatric residents. Objective: This study evaluated the impact of a 9-month RCDP booster training on PALS skills compared with usual practice debriefing (plus/delta) after an initial RCDP training session for PALS-certified pediatric interns. Methods: All pediatric interns at a single institution were invited to a 45-minute RCDP training session after their initial PALS certification. The PALS performance score and times for key events were recorded for participants immediately before and after the RCDP training as well as 6, 9, and 12 months after the RCDP training. Learners were randomized to an RCDP intervention and usual practice (plus/delta) group. The intervention group received booster RCDP training after their 9-month assessment. Results: Twenty eight of 30 residents participated in the initial training with 22 completing randomization at 9 months. There was no significant difference in 12-month PALS median performance scores after the booster training between the intervention and usual practice groups (83% vs. 94%, P = 0.31). There was significant improvement in PALS performance score from 51 +/- 27% pre-initial RCDP assessment to 93 +/- 5% post-initial RCDP training (P < 0.001). There were significant improvements in individual skills from pre- to post-initial RCDP testing, including time to verbalize pulseless, start compressions, and attach defibrillation pads (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Rapid cycle deliberate practice booster training versus plus/delta training at 9-month post-initial RCDP training did not alter 12-month performance. However, RCDP is effective at improving PALS performance skills, and this effect is maintained at 6, 9, and 12 months. Our study supports the importance of supplemental resuscitation training in addition to the traditional PALS course. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Acquisition of Teamwork and Communication Skills Using High-Technology Simulation for Preclerkship Medical Students
AB  - Introduction: Teamwork failures are a major source of preventable error in medicine. Acquisition of skills early in training seems beneficial for impacting system-level change. Simulation-based curricula provide a psychologically safe and formative environment to learn and practice team skills. This project aims to assess teamwork and communication skill acquisition in preclerkship medical students during a longitudinal simulation-based curriculum. Methods: This is a prospective, observational study of medical students participating in a high-technology simulation curriculum on team principles. Students, in groups of 5 to 7, participated in 6 mannequin-based simulation sessions over 10 months coordinated with an organ system-based preclerkship course. Each scenario was executed by a simulation technologist and guided by a simulation educator who functioned as a bedside nurse and led a postsimulation debrief. Likert-based, self- and global assessments completed by students and facilitators, respectively, were used to evaluate the teams. Descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze data using a P value of less than 0.05 for statistical significance and a null hypothesis stating that there would be no change in behavior. The primary outcome measure was improvement in the teamwork and communication domains of both assessments. Results: Students (N = 231) were divided into the same 32 groups during every session. At the end of every session, each student completed a self-assessment and each educator completed the team's global assessment for teamwork. Median scores for teamwork and communication domains increased between the first and sixth sessions on both assessments. Mann-Whitney U analysis of self-assessment scores showed Z values between -5.30 and -8.83 and P values of less than 0.00001. Mann-Whitney U analysis of global assessment scores showed Z values ranging from -3.43 to -5.24 and P values between 0.0031 and less than 0.00001. Conclusions: There was meaningful improvement in scores in the domains of teamwork and communication over the 10-month, simulation-based curriculum designed to teach and hone teamwork skills.

T1  - Life-Saving Procedures Performed While Wearing CBRNe Personal Protective Equipment: A Mannequin Randomized Trial
AB  - Introduction: Chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear-explosive (CBRNe) are complex events. Decontamination is mandatory to avoid harm and contain hazardous materials, but can delay care. Therefore, the stabilization of patients in the warm zone seems reasonable, but research is limited. Moreover, subjects involved in biological events are considered infectious even after decontamination and need to be managed while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), as seen with Ebola and COVID-19 pandemic. With this simulation mannequin trial, we assessed the impact of CBRNe PPE on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and combat casualty care procedures. Methods: We compared procedures performed by emergency medicine and anesthesiology senior residents, randomized in 2 groups (CBRNe PPE vs. no PPE). Chest compression (CC) depth was defined as the primary outcome. Time to completion was calculated for the following: tourniquet application; tension pneumothorax needle decompression; peripheral venous access (PVA) and intraosseous access positioning; and drug preparation and administration. A questionnaire was delivered to evaluate participants' perception. Results: Thirty-six residents participated. No significant difference between the groups in CC depth (mean difference = 0.26 cm [95% confidence interval = -0.26 to 0.77 cm, P = 0.318]), as well as for CC rate, CC complete release, and time for drugs preparation and administration was detected. The PPE contributed to significantly higher times for tourniquet application, tension pneumothorax decompression, peripheral venous access, and intraosseous access positioning. The residents found simulation relevant to the residencies' core curriculum. Conclusions: This study suggests that cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be performed while wearing PPE without impacting quality, whereas other tasks requiring higher dexterity can be significantly impaired by PPE.

T1  - Debriefing for Simulation-Based Medical Education: A Survey From the International Network of Simulation-Based Pediatric Innovation, Research and Education
AB  - Context: Current debriefing approaches and faculty development strategies for simulation educators differ around the world. We aim to describe the status of current debriefing practice and faculty development for simulation educators in this study. Methods: We distributed a paper-based survey during 2 international conferences to obtain data from active International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research and Education members. The survey was tested to ensure content validity and consisted of the following 3 constructs: demographic characteristics, current debriefing practice, and issues related to faculty development. Results: One hundred nine of 114 participants (96%) completed the survey. Debriefing practice differs in terms of timing, duration, framework, and conversational framework. Most debriefings were less than 30 minutes (93/109, 85%), with many educators not using objective data during debriefing (47/109, 43%). Three- or 4-phase debriefing frameworks were used most commonly (66/109, 61%). Most participants have access to some faculty development opportunities (99/109, 91%). Barriers to faculty development are related to time and resource constraints (eg, freeing up facilitator's time: 75/109, 69%, competing priorities 64/109, 59%). Most participants indicated that their needs for debriefing to improve learning outcomes were met (95/109, 87%). The desired content for future faculty development opportunities varies between educators with different levels of expertise. Conclusions: Approaches to debriefing among members of an international pediatric simulation network vary considerably. Although faculty development opportunities were available to most participants, future simulation programs should work on addressing barriers and optimizing faculty development plans to meet the needs of their educators.

T1  - Simulation-Based Mastery Learning Improves Ultrasound-Guided Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Insertion Skills of Practicing Nurses
AB  - Introduction: Difficult intravenous (IV) access (DIVA) is frequently encountered in the hospital setting. Ultrasound-guided peripheral IV catheter (USGPIV) insertion has emerged as an effective procedure to establish access in patients with DIVA. Despite the increased use of USGPIV, little is known about the optimal training paradigms for bedside nurses. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a novel, sustainable, USGPIV simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) curriculum for nurses. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of an USGPIV SBML training program for bedside nurses over a 12-month period. We evaluated skills and self-confidence before and after training and measured the proportion of the nurses achieving independent, proctor, and instructor status. Procedure logs and surveys were used to explore the nurse experience and utilization of USGPIV on real patients with DIVA 3 months after the intervention. Results: Two hundred thirty-eight nurses enrolled in the study. The USGPIV skill checklist scores increased from median of 6.0 [interquartile range = 4.0-9.0 (pretest) to 29.0, interquartile range = 28-30 (posttest), P < 0.001]. The USGPIV confidence improved from before (mean = 2.32, SD = 1.17) to after (mean = 3.85, SD = 0.73, P < 0.001) training (5-point Likert scale). Sixty-two percent of the nurses enrolled achieved independent status, 47.5% became proctors, and 11.3% course trainers. At 3-month posttraining, the nurses had attempted a mean of 35.6 USGPIV insertions with an 89.5% success rate. Conclusions: This novel USGPIV SBML curriculum improves nurses' insertion skills, self-confidence, and progresses patient care through USGPIV insertions on hospitalized patients with DIVA.

T1  - Latent Safety Threats and Countermeasures in the Operating Theater: A National In Situ Simulation-Based Observational Study
AB  - Introduction: In situ simulation provides a valuable opportunity to identify latent safety threats (LSTs) in real clinical environments. Using a national simulation program, we explored latent safety threats (LSTs) identified during in situ multidisciplinary simulation-based training in operating theaters in hospitals across New Zealand. Method: Surgical simulations lasting between 15 and 45 minutes each were run as part of a team training course delivered in 21 hospitals in New Zealand. After surgical in situ simulations, instructors used a template to record identified LSTs in a postcourse report. We analyzed these reports using the contributory factors framework from the London Protocol to categorize LSTs. Results: Of 103 postcourse reports across 21 hospitals, 77 contained LSTs ranging across all factors in the London Protocol. Common threats included staff knowledge and skills in emergencies, team factors, factors related to task or technology, and work environment threats. Team factors were also commonly reported as protecting against adverse events, in particular, creating a shared mental model. Examples of actions taken to address threats included replacing or repairing faulty equipment, clarifying emergency processes, correcting written information, and staff training for clinical emergencies. Conclusions: The pervasiveness of LSTs suggests that our results have widespread relevance to surgical departments throughout New Zealand and elsewhere and that collective solutions would be valuable. In situ simulation is an effective mechanism both for identifying threats to patient safety and to prompt initiatives for improvement, supporting the use of in situ simulation in the quality improvement cycle in healthcare.

T1  - Modeling Performance of Open Surgical Cases
AB  - Introduction: Previous efforts used digital video to develop computer-generated assessments of surgical hand motion economy and fluidity of motion. This study tests how well previously trained assessment models match expert ratings of suturing and tying video clips recorded in a new operating room (OR) setting Methods: Enabled through computer vision of the hands, this study tests the applicability of assessments born out of benchtop simulations to in vivo suturing and tying tasks recorded in the OR. Results: Compared with expert ratings, computer-generated assessments for fluidity of motion (slope = 0.83, intercept = 1.77, R2 = 0.55) performed better than motion economy (slope = 0.73, intercept = 2.04, R2 = 0.49), although 85% of ratings for both models were within +/-2 of the expert response. Neither assessment performed as well in the OR as they did on the training data. Assessments were sensitive to changing hand postures, dropped ligatures, and poor tissue contact-features typically missing from training data. Computer-generated assessment of OR tasks was contingent on a clear, consistent view of both surgeon's hands. Conclusions: Computer-generated assessment may help provide formative feedback during deliberate practice, albeit with greater variability in the OR compared with benchtop simulations. Future work will benefit from expanded available bimanual video records. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Making Concepts Material: A Randomized Trial Exploring Simulation as a Medium to Enhance Cognitive Integration and Transfer of Learning
AB  - Background: Simulation affords opportunities to represent functional relationships between conceptual (eg, anatomy) and procedural knowledge (eg, needle insertion technique) in ways that make them accessible to our many senses. Despite deprioritizing realism, such simulations may encourage trainees to create cognitive connections between these knowledge (ie, cognitive integration), which may improve transfer of learning. However, the impact of such "integrated instruction" has not been examined in simulation-based training. We developed integrated video- and simulator-based instructional modules for lumbar puncture training and compared their impacts on participants' retention, transfer, and conceptual knowledge. Methods: During 1 hour of simulation-based training, we randomized 66 medical students to receive either (a) video-based procedural-only instruction, (b) integrated video-based instruction, or (c) integrated simulator-based instruction. One week later, we tested participants' retention and transfer performances and their conceptual knowledge on a written test. Results: Simple mediation analyses revealed that compared with participants receiving procedural-only instruction, participants receiving integrated instruction had superior retention and transfer outcomes, mediated by gains in conceptual knowledge (all P  0.01). Conclusions: We extended previous findings, showing integrated instruction (video- or simulator-based) improved trainees' conceptual knowledge, which mediated their improved retention and transfer. As an innovation, we demonstrated how simulators can facilitate cognitive integration by making abstract conceptual-procedural relationships material. In suggesting how researchers might capitalize further on simulator-based integration, we offer an alternative framework for designing simulations that emphasizes cognitive processes rather than simulator fidelity.

T1  - Mass Training In Situ During COVID-19 Pandemic: Enhancing Efficiency and Minimizing Sick Leaves
AB  - Introduction: Avoiding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) work-related infection in frontline healthcare workers is a major challenge. A massive training program was launched in our university hospital for anesthesia/intensive care unit and operating room staff, aiming at upskilling 2249 healthcare workers for COVID-19 patients' management. We hypothesized that such a massive training was feasible in a 2-week time frame and efficient in avoiding sick leaves. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study. Training focused on personal protective equipment donning/doffing and airway management in a COVID-19 simulated patient. The educational models used were in situ procedural and immersive simulation, peer-teaching, and rapid cycle deliberate practice. Self-learning organization principles were used for trainers' management. Ordinary disease quantity in full-time equivalent in March and April 2020 were compared with the same period in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Results: A total of 1668 healthcare workers were trained (74.2% of the target population) in 99 training sessions over 11 days. The median number of learners per session was 16 (interquartile range = 9-25). In the first 5 days, the median number of people trained per weekday was 311 (interquartile range = 124-385). Sick leaves did not increase in March to April 2020 compared with the same period in the 3 preceding years. Conclusions: Massive training for COVID-19 patient management in frontline healthcare workers is feasible in a very short time and efficient in limiting the rate of sick leave. This experience could be used in the anticipation of new COVID-19 waves or for rapidly preparing hospital staff for an unexpected major health crisis. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Factors Affecting Implementation of Simulation-Based Education After Faculty Training in a Low-Resource Setting
AB  - Introduction: Simulation instructor training is a recognized key component of health care simulation implementation, including in low-resource settings. PediSTARS India (Pediatric Simulation Training and Research Society) has developed and delivered several instructor training courses and more recently a 3-level faculty development program. However, there is variability in adoption of simulation at workplaces. The goal of this study was to identify factors that influence translation of instructor training into workplace simulation. Methods: At the conclusion of their faculty development program, participants of the 2018 PediSTARS simulation instructor workshop were invited to participate in a qualitative study with an online questionnaire followed by a semistructured interview. The 3 key questions explored the "enablers," "barriers," and "changes needed" at workplaces for simulation-based training. The responses were analyzed and classified into broad themes. Results: Of the 76 participants of the workshop, 11 were interviewed. The enablers were classified under 3 themes; "management support," "trained team" and "smart sourcing." Barriers were "lack of infrastructure," "lack of time," and "lack of simulation culture." The proposed changes were to "raise awareness," "strengthen systems," and "curricular integration." Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of institutional leadership support for simulation-based training and also that new instructors should focus on training teams in the workplace and mapping simulation activities to existing curricula. These results have wide applicability to a variety of health care settings and instructor training programs. Collaboration between organizations for further research about the impact of simulation-based training on patient safety and outcomes is also required. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Implementation of Distance-Based Simulation Training Programs for Healthcare Professionals: Breaking Barriers During COVID-19 Pandemic
AB  - Summary Statement: The sudden rise of critically ill patients secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered a surge in healthcare response. This project's goal was to provide essential cognitive and technical skills to healthcare professionals returning to the workforce or reassigned to critical care clinical duties during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan included the implementation of 4 distance-based simulation training programs, with asynchronous personalized feedback. The courses allowed the acquisition of skills for the complete critical care patient management chain: use of personal protection equipment, use of a high-flow nasal cannula, endotracheal intubation, and prone positioning. Participants logged into the platform, reviewed material, practiced while recording the session, and uploaded the video through the training platform. The expert tutor remotely delivered asynchronous feedback. Participants trained remotely until achieving course approval. Remote-based simulation seems a feasible and attractive alternative to provide adequate educational solutions, especially for remote and rural areas. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Medical Student Ultrasound-Guided Intravenous Catheter Education: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Overtraining in a Simulation-Based Mastery Learning Setting
AB  - Introduction: Simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) improves skill transfer to humans. However, limited data exist to support the practice of performing additional training attempts once mastery has been achieved. We explored whether implementing this concept in an SBML model improves skill transfer in ultrasound-guided peripheral intravenous (USGPIV) catheter placement from simulator to humans. Methods: Forty-eight first- and second-year medical students underwent SBML for USGPIV placement to mastery standards on a simulator once to achieve minimum passing standard based on a 19-item checklist. Next, they completed either 0, 4, or 8 additional mastery level simulated performances in nonconsecutive order before attempting USGPIV placement on a human. An unplanned post hoc retention phase occurred 6 months later where participants' USGPIV skills were reassessed on a second human volunteer using the same checklist. Results: In this sample, the success rate among the 3 training cohorts did not improve as the number of additional training sessions increased (exact P = 0.60) and were comparable among the 3 cohorts (exact P = 0.82). The overall checklist performance was also comparable among the 3 cohorts (exact P = 0.57). In an unplanned (small) sample of returning participants, the USGPIV retention rate exceeded 80% for those originally assigned to 4 or 8 sessions, whereas the retention rate fell less than 50% for those originally assigned to control. Among these returning participants, the overall success rate was 58% on the initial assessment and was 68% on retention. Conclusions: In this sample of novices, we were unable to show that up to 8 additional mastery level performances of USGPIV placement on a simulator following SBML training improve skill transfer for both USGPIV placement success and total checklist performance.

T1  - Simulation for Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation Training: How Different Is It From Clinical Practice?
AB  - Introduction: Neonatal endotracheal intubation is a critical skill that is difficult for learners to acquire even with simulation-based training (SBT). Trainees prefer clinical experiences over SBT. The objective of the study was to explore the differences between SBT and clinical practice in acquiring neonatal intubation skills to inform mannequin design and to improve fidelity. Methods: A basic qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted to determine the experience of newly competent trainees (second- and third-year neonatal-perinatal medicine fellows) and their instructors in developing intubation skills. Participants were asked to compare learning through SBT with clinical practice in terms of context, equipment, and environment. Their responses were analyzed using an inductive approach. Results: Thirty-two participants (20 fellows and 12 faculty) indicated that SBT does not equal the real experience. Specifically, the look, feel, and function of the simulators differ enough from the real patient and the clinical environmental that they do not elicit the desired learning responses. The clinical environment prompted heightened emotions and had a chaotic atmosphere that was not fully captured by SBT. Participants suggested that programs use SBT in the initial phases of training only to gain basic skills and they provided several solutions for mannequin and SBT session design. Conclusions: Simulation-based training does not fully prepare neonatal-perinatal medicine fellows for neonatal intubation. Mannequins with unique active features, such as multiple airway configurations, slipperiness, secretions, and softer textures should be developed. Realistic environments that replicate the interprofessional nature and stressors of the clinical environment might better prepare learners for the complexity of clinical practice.

T1  - Synchronization of Pupil Dilations Correlates With Team Performance in a Simulated Laparoscopic Team Coordination Task
AB  - Background: Modern surgery crucially relies on teamwork between surgeons and assistants. The science of teamwork has been and is being studied extensively although the use of specific objective methodologies such as shared pupil dilations has not been studied as sufficiently as subjective methods. In this study, we investigated team members' shared pupil dilations as a surrogate for surgeon's team performance during a simulated laparoscopic procedure. Methods: Fourteen subjects formed dyad teams to perform a simulated laparoscopic object transportation task. Both team members' pupil dilation and eye gaze were tracked simultaneously during the procedure. Video analysis was used to identify key event movement landmarks for subtask segmentation to facilitate data analysis. Three levels of each teams' performance were determined according to task completion time and accuracy (object dropping times). The determined coefficient of determination (R2) was used to calculate the similarity in pupil dilations between 2 individual members' pupil diameters in each team. A mixed-design analysis of variance was conducted to explore how team performance level and task type were correlated to joint pupil dilation. Results: The results showed that pupil dilations of higher performance teams were more synchronized, with significantly higher similarities (R2) in pupil dilation patterns between team members than those of lower performance teams (0.36 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.14, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Levels of pupil dilation synchronization presented among teams reflect differences in performance levels while executing simulated laparoscopic tasks; this demonstrated the potential of using joint pupil dilation as an objective indicator of surgical teamwork performance.

T1  - Simulation Use in Outreach Setting: A Novel Approach to Building Sustainability
AB  - Summary Statement: Simulation is a well-studied teaching tool for multidisciplinary teamwork, crisis resource management, and communication skills. These attributes are essential for successful international medical missions, which include healthcare providers with different familiarities with the outreach environment and each team member's role. However, immersive simulation remains underused in similar settings. Our team designed a simulation-based curriculum that focuses on multidisciplinary teamwork and crisis resource management skills. In this commentary, we describe its implementation during high-risk cleft care outreach missions conducted by the Global Smile Foundation. We discuss the importance of a simple, feasible, and flexible platform to successfully overcome the limitations of time and resources inherent to outreach mission work while addressing the clinical and geographic needs specific to each site. We highlight challenges, including unpredictability of the outreach environment, a language barrier, and the short duration of missions. Finally, we offer a roadmap for groups involved in similar global health efforts. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Using Motion Tracking to Analyze Forceps Paths During Simulated Forceps-Assisted Vaginal Deliveries
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of motion tracking to discern variation in forceps paths during standardized simulated forceps-assisted vaginal deliveries among experienced and inexperienced obstetric providers. Methods: This is a pilot study involving 24 obstetrics and gynecology residents and 6 faculty at a single institution. Each participant was filmed performing standardized simulated forceps-assisted vaginal deliveries on a high-fidelity model. Motion tracking software (Kinovea, Medoc, France) was used to track the path of the forceps shank. Data were analyzed for total path length, total x-plane displacement, total y-plane displacement, and final forceps angle. One-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate for statistically significant differences between groups based on education year, with Turkey HSD post hoc test to identify interactions. Results: Statistically significant differences were noted between groups in the total path length (F = 7.57, P < 0.001) and total y-plane displacement (F = 5.79, P < 0.001). On pairwise comparison, significant differences were noted between faculty and postgraduate year 1 as well as faculty and postgraduate year 2 for total y-plane displacement and total path length. Significant differences were not observed between groups for total x-plane displacement (F = 0.89, P = 0.475) and final forceps angle (F = 2.45, P = 0.052). Conclusions: Motion tracking of standardized simulated forceps-assisted vaginal deliveries identifies statistically significant differences between experienced and inexperienced obstetric providers. Our findings suggest that motion tracking can be used to design an educational intervention to improve forceps technique among obstetrics and gynecology residents.

T1  - The Addition of High-Technology Into the Stop the Bleed Program Among School Personnel Improves Short-Term Skill Application, Not Long-Term Retention
AB  - Introduction: The Stop the Bleed (STB) program trains the general public on identifying and treating life-threatening bleeding. Data on efficacy and retention of skills taught through this program are limited, with the role of high-technology modalities to augment the program, such as simulation and feedback devices, untested. Methods: A convenience sample of 66 school personnel participated in an open-label observational study from January to August 2019. The control group received the standard bleeding control course, while the intervention group received the bleeding control course with addition of a simulation and a feedback device for wound packing. Assessment was performed by STB instructors using performance metrics from prior studies as well as a feedback device. Retention testing was performed 2 to 8 months after intervention. The study was approved by the hospital's institutional review board. Results: The intervention group performed better than the control group on correct tourniquet application [90.3% vs. 71.0%; odds ratio (OR) = 11.28; P = 0.015; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.86 to 104.67] wound packing scores (59.5% vs. 29.6%; OR = 0.33; P = 0.007; 95% CI = 9.36 to 56.00) and were more likely to assess their safety (OR = 5.49; P = 0.034; 95% CI = 1.28 to 27.66), and reported higher comfort scores on stepping into an emergency scenario (OR = 11.19; P = 0.004; 95% CI = 2.51 to 63.11), wound packing (OR = 5.16; P = 0.025; 95% CI = 1.35 to 22.46), and using a tourniquet (OR = 11.41; P = 0.003; 95% CI = 2.57 to 67.59). Thirty-one participants (46.9%) were assessed again at retention 2 to 8 months later where scores for tourniquet placement and wound packing were not significantly different in the two groups. Conclusions: Augmenting STB with simulation and feedback improved both self-reported comfort level and skill set of participants, but the retention of skills was poor in both groups.

T1  - The Challenges of Dyad Practice in Simulation Training of Basic Open Surgical Skills-A Mixed-Method Study
AB  - Introduction: Simulation training at home improves access to training, but motivation can be difficult to maintain. Dyad training could keep trainees motivated. This study aimed to examine the effect of self-regulated training of basic surgical skills in pairs versus individually. Methods: One hundred one medical doctors were included in this prospective, mixed-method, simulation-based study. Participants were randomized to train individually or in pairs during a 6-week course in open surgical skills, consisting of didactic instructions and self-directed training at home. Trainees kept a training log and filled in a questionnaire. Skills were tested before and after the course. Tests were rated by an expert using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills Global Rating Scale. Results: Ninety-seven doctors completed the study. We found no differences in test score between dyad and individual trainees. Dyad trainees compared with individual trainees improved by 7.23 points (intercept estimate) versus 6.94 points, respectively (P = 0.881). Dyad trainees trained less frequently [7.3 times (intercept estimate) vs. 12.1 times, P < 0.001, but for longer intervals compared with individual trainees (68 minutes vs. 38 minutes)]. Dyad trainees reported benefits such as having a sparring partner, receiving feedback, corrections, increased motivation, having fun, and more structured training sessions. However, the coordination of training sessions was difficult. Conclusions: No differences were found between dyad trainees and individual trainees in improvement of surgical skills. Off-site dyad training led to fewer, but longer training sessions, which may have negatively impacted the effectiveness of training. Dyad trainees perceived dyad training beneficial.

T1  - Personalized Training Schedules for Retention and Sustainment of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Skills
AB  - Introduction: The study examined how the spacing of training during initial acquisition of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skill affects longer-term retention and sustainment of these skills. Methods: This was a multiphased, longitudinal study. Nursing students were randomly assigned to 2 initial acquisition conditions in which they completed 4 consecutive CPR training sessions spaced by shorter (1 or 7 days) or longer (30 or 90 days) training intervals. Students were additionally randomized to refresh skills for 1 year every 3 months, 6 months, or at a personalized interval prescribed by the Predictive Performance Optimizer (PPO), a cognitive tool that predicts learning and decay over time. Results: At the end of the acquisition period, performance was better if training intervals were shorter. At 3 or 6 months after acquisition, performance was better if initial training intervals were longer. At 1 year after acquisition, compression and ventilation scores did not differ by initial training interval nor by 3-month or PPO-prescribed sustainment interval refreshers. However, 6-month interval refreshers were worse than the PPO for compressions and worse than 3 months for ventilations. At the final test session, participants in the personalized PPO condition had less variability in compression scores than either the 3- or 6-month groups. Conclusions: Results suggest that CPR learning trajectories may be accelerated by first spacing training sessions by days and then expanding to longer intervals. Personalized scheduling may improve performance, minimize performance variability, and reduce overall training time. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare

T1  - Cultural Considerations in Debriefing
AB  - Summary Statement: Culture influences how we communicate, teach, and learn. Debriefings are laden with cultural influences. Without attention to cultural considerations, accepted debriefing techniques might not reach the desired outcome and, in certain cultures, may even harm teacher-learner relationships. We explore cultural considerations in healthcare simulation debriefing and offer guidance for debriefers to gain awareness of potential cultural biases. (C) 2021 Society for Simulation in Healthcare
